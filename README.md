# Detection-Lab-Using-Splunk

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.


## Download VirtualBox
  
You will need to download a virtualization software otherwise known as a Hypervisor such as VMware, Hyper-V, or even Virtualbox. For this Lab, we will be using VirtualBox. Download whatever version of Virtualbox fits your current OS using the following link: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads.

You can customize settings such as where the software will be downloaded to if you have multiple drives, but the defaults work perfectly fine

## Downloading your Virtual Machines.
### For the Windows VM you will need to create a windows OS Image. The safest way to do so will be to create our own via the following link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10

Once you reach this page you will need to scroll down and click "Create Windows 10 installation media"

During the setup process you will be asked to either:

 - Upgrade this PC now
 
 - Create Installation Media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC

 Select "Create Installation Media"

You may customize or use the recommended settings for your pc. I recommend using the default settings.

After that you prompted with the option of either:

- USB Flash Drive

- ISO File

  Choose ISO File.
